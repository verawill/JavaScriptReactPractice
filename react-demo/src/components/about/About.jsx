          <p>
          Hello, I am a passionate Computer Science student at the University of Washington, currently set to graduate in March 2024 as a first generation student.
          With a strong academic foundation in software design, algorithms, public speaking, and embedded systems, 
          I am driven by a deep commitment to both technical excellence and community engagement. My interests are currently the gym, relaxing
          with family, and running my side hustle reselling shoes and clothing.
          </p>
          <p>
          Currently I work with AVELA and SHPE to provide STEM education to underrepresented communities in the Western side of Washington.
          AVELA is a nonprofit organization ran by University of Washington students that dedicates its resources to bring education 
          to classrooms who may not have access to STEM programs. Currently, 
          Iâ€™m an active student teacher who focuses on programming and encouraging students to explore a path at college by providing 
          resources through powerpoint slides.
          </p>
          <p>As I come to the end of my academic career at the University of Washington I am actively pursing an opportunity at a company 
            that will align with my interests and provide me an opportunity to display my computer science abilities.</p>
